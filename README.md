# CNN-Face-Recognition
Facial Recognition  using Convolutional Neural Network

First of all, you need to download the pre-trained model of Keras <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4ChsjFJvew3NkF0dTc1OGxsOFU/view" target="_blank">Here</a> and put it into /data folder.

Put your the images to recognize in /pictures (you need to do some simple modifications inside :blush:)

## Prerequisites
You need also to prepare your environment by downloading those python tools (I'm working in Anaconda but it's optional)
* Python 3.7
* cv2 (Famous openCv library)
* Keras (to run the pre-trained model)
* numpy (for some vectorization calcula)
* matplot (ploting the result)
* PIL (Python Imaging Library)
* pickle (For object serialization)
* tkinter (To run the user Interface)

## Run
Run the init.py first to save the values of your images, then run the main.py file.
